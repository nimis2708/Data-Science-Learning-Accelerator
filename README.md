The Data Science Learning Accelerator (DSLA) is a platform designed to fast-track learning in data science through hands-on, project-based experiences. It offers curated Knowledge Objects (KOs) — including tutorials, datasets, and challenges — that guide learners in building practical skills. The goal is to provide an interactive and personalized learning journey aligned with real-world data science workflows.
